- `.wslconfig` belongs in `/mnt/c/Users/<USERNAME>`.
- `settings.json` was used in older Windows Terminal (0.11) versions. It may be
  obsolete now, but is kept here for reference.
- `ubuntu-color-scheme-for-windows-terminal.json` is my custom Ubuntu color
  scheme encoding for Windows Terminal. It is based on the "Tango Dark" default
  theme.
